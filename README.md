Diaggregation of daily to hourly 

    Given daily precipitation, min/max temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, shortwave/longwave radiations (optional), 
    a disaggregating process is implemented to produce hourly climate data for precipitatoin, temperature, wind speed, relative/specific humidity,
    water vapor, atmosphere pressure, cloudiness fraction and shortwave/longwave radiations.
